\description{
\code{open_goat_door()} HOST OPENS GOAT DOOR.
}
\details{
The host will always open a door with a goat behind it,
but it canâ€™t be a door the contestant has already selected.
So it must be a door that is not a car and not a current
contestant selection.
Note that if the contestant selects the car on the first guess
the host can open either door, but if the contestant selects
a goat the host only has one option.
